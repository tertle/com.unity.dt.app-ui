    "changelog": "### Changed\n\n- Scrollable manipulator now stops the propagation of WheelEvent. This affects only the Drawer and SwipeView elements.\n- Refactored the SwipeView element logic, without impacting the public API.\n- The Canvas now uses `Experimental.Animation` system from UI-Toolkit for its damping effect when releasing the mouse with some velocity. That replaces the previous implementation that was using the `VisualElementScheduledItem`.\n- Changed fade in animation in Tooltip to use USS transitions.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed the wrap system of the SwipeView element when swiping between elements quickly.\n- Fixed Daisy chaining window procedures on Windows platform.\n- Fixed an edge case when popovers are dismissed as OutOfBounds as soon as Show() is called.\n- Invoke click event only if Pressable is still hovered.\n- Fixed styling of emphasized checkboxes.\n- Fixed a bug where tooltips stop being shown when the window is docked/undocked.\n\n### Added\n\n- Added `justified` property on Tabs component to jusitfy tabs layout in horizontal direction.\n- Added `damping-effect-duration` property in Canvas element. The default value is 750ms.\n- Added `IsContextClick()` extension method for PointerEvent.\n- Added support of graceful fallback to lambda `Plafform` implementation if native plugins can not be loaded by the current plaftorm."
